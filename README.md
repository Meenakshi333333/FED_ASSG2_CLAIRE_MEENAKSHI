# Our Website for MokeSell

## The Design Rationale
We wanted to design and create a ecommerce platform selling pre-loved items to be welcomed and well-used by the younger generations. In doing so, we decided on a few things we wanted from out website. Firstly, simplicity of the user interface and designs. Next, a chic yet modern UX that will attract and please those of the younger generation. With these key points in mind, we believe that we would be able to create the most used ecommerce platform used by the youths in our generation.
